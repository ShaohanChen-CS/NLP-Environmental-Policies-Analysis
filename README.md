# NLP Environmental Policies Analysis

This project implements a lightweight NLP data processing pipeline to analyze real-world Reddit discussions on environmental policies.

The goal is to transform noisy, unstructured text data into structured, reusable sentiment metrics through standardized preprocessing, sentiment scoring, and aggregation workflows.

The pipeline is designed to be reusable. New data sources can be added to the raw data directory and processed through the same workflow without changes to the core logic.
